# Machine Learning Templates + Concepts

> This repository consists of my notes and implementations of different machine learning models. 

**Note:  This repo is regarding the A-Z machine learning course, and so I have kept some images of the slides in the colab files for my reference.**

## Take-aways from this:
- It consists of templates for a variety of topics starting from the preprocessing stage to numerous machine learning models.
- I've tried to implement different models covering regression, classification, clustering, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and association-rule learning.
- While completing the course, I thought of maintaining a repository for quick access to templates of different models as well as, the concepts behind that model.
- ***Only python implementation for each model is present.*** 

## Steps to use:
- [x] Click on any one of the below categories to get direct access to any model.
- [x] Click on 'open in colab' option to get access to the ipynb file on Google Colab. 
- [x] Everything is present with two major categories as Theory and Implementation in the colab file. 
- [x] Remove the Theory part to get a basic template for that model.

## Direct access to different models:

2. [Regression](https://github.com/atharvapatil123/ML_Practice/tree/master/Regression)
3. [Classification](https://github.com/atharvapatil123/ML_Practice/tree/master/Classification)
4. [Clustering](https://github.com/atharvapatil123/ML_Practice/tree/master/Clustering)
5. [Association_Rule_Learning](https://github.com/atharvapatil123/ML_Practice/tree/master/Association%20Rule%20Learning)
6. [Reinforcement_Learning](https://github.com/atharvapatil123/ML_Practice/tree/master/Reinforcement%20Learning)
7. [Natural_Language_Processing](https://github.com/atharvapatil123/ML_Practice/tree/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing)
8. [Deep_Learning](https://github.com/atharvapatil123/ML_Practice/tree/master/Deep%20Learning)

## Reviews:
- I shall highly recommend the Machine Learning A-Z Course to everyone, especially a beginner in ML, who wants to have a clear understanding of different concepts in Machine Learning and wants to kickstart their journey in this highly evolving domain. 
- The course is available on Udemy [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/). It is also available for free [here](https://freelearningapp.com/course/machine-learning-a-z-hands-on-python-r-in-data-science-updated). 
- Note: This course does not provide an in-depth explanation of some core topics like deep learning. However, a high-level overview with implementation is delivered.
